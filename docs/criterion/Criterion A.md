# Criterion A - Planning
## Part 1 - Defining the Problem:

My client is a lepidopterist, a person who studies moths and butterflies. They regularly catch and document moths across the country and are involved with some wildlife conservation organisations. Currently, their main method of documenting their finds is through photographs and notes however they feel that this is an inefficient method as it quickly becomes unorganised, and it is hard to find past records. On top of this when working with wildlife organisations they have found it hard to access historical data which can provide an insight into changes in moth populations and highlight at risk species.

My proposed solution for their problem is a Java application which allows for users to store records of their finds along with additional data such as the location and time of year. These records would be stored in a public database which could be searched for specific species and display how many records of a species there have been in a given period of time, allowing for conservation organisations to utilise the data.

## Part 2 - Rationale for Solution:

The purpose of this application is to allow my client to store and retrieve user driven data about moths. The application will be written in Java to leverage the benefits of Object-Oriented Programing as this allows for a modular approach to be taken to manage the data making it easy to add additional features. Additionally, Java is platform-independent allowing for the application to be used on several systems.

## Part 3 - Criteria for Success:

- Users will be able to register and login to their own accounts.
- Users will be able to add, edit and remove records of their finds
- Users will be able to view historical trends in the records
- The records will be searchable for various characteristics including: name, location and date / time of year
- There will be a user privilege system (allowing some users to be moderators or verified users)
- Moderators will be able to remove records they deem unlikely (e.g. records for a rare species submitted with a location that the species has not been recorded in before by a new user)

## Appendix:

_**Minutes from meeting with Client on Monday, 4 April 2022:**_

- Client outlined their requirements which included the ability to have an account, be able to login, enter data (preferably in a variety of ways) and perform searches using different search criteria such as ‘location’ and ‘month’.
- Client expressed interest in using ‘time’ data for planning future trips.
- Client identified ‘habitats’ as an additional search criteria.
- Discussed the possibility of combining ‘location’, ’habitat’ and ‘time’ data to be used to produce a ‘target’ list of moths fitting the criteria, which as far as Client is aware no existing moth database can currently do.
- Client spoke about how a conservation organisation might use the data to compare counts over time and the potential benefits of this.
- Client identified additional search criteria including ‘life cycle’ characteristics (food sources…), again, as far as Client is aware this is not currently possible on existing databases.
- Explored how data will be inputted including use of existing generic data in combination with individual users' data.
- Discussed need for verification procedure for users / records to ensure accuracy and validity of data inputted.
- Explored need for a moderator or whether users will self sustain the database.
- Discussed possible need for different user privileges, including some for administrators who could check records.
- Discussed whether to limit the number of records on the database due to potential large size.
- Identified potential users who might be willing to test the database.
- Spoke about the possibility for databases to record ‘trends’ in data collection.
- Discussed website ideas. Client offered use of their photographic images.
- Identified additional ‘descriptive' criteria, including size within search.
- Discussed primary use of database as a way to either ‘record’ or to ‘identify’. Client clarified three needs; 1) for individual users to record their findings 2) for users to use a location / time search and 3) for organisations to use to identify trends.
- Discussed privacy and copyright issues, for example if users were to upload their own photographs.
- Discussed next steps including limiting initial size of project, timescales and future meetings.
